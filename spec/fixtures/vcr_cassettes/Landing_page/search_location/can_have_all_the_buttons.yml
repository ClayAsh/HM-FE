        farmers. Tenant farming was a common pattern of land use and livelihood for
        much of the area during most of the twentieth century. The Ray Beierle family
        worked as tenant farmers for more than fifty years. They worked at this farm
        for three different landlords, the Grossmans, the District Land Owners Trust
        and finally for Box Elder Farms until 1990. In addition, the Beierle Farm

        Denver International Airport site has a Euroamerican history that can be traced
        to the early nineteenth century.  Today, cultural remains and archival information
        exist to explain and interpret that history.  The primary past land uses of
        the airport site offer an easily comprehensible vehicle for viewing the history
        of the area.  The earliest uses Euroamericans found for the airport site and
        the lands around it were connected to the development of a Colorado plains
        transportation network.  The second, and more pervasive, use was for agriculture.  The
        agricultural uses represent many specializations including ranching, dryland
        and irrigated farming, dairying and cattle feeding in preparation for marketing.  The
        relative importance of these activities changed over time as did the methods
        different individuals used.  Closely associated with agriculture have been
        shifts in land ownership patterns.  By 1910 most of the land had passed from
        the public domain into private ownership.  After that transition occurred,
        the most significant change has been growth of tenant farming.  In many ways
        the Euroamerican history of the airport site study area is a microcosm of
        the history of the larger northeastern Colorado plains area.","photo_url":"https://stage.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=Photograph:

        barn is constructed of crude cast-in-place concrete up to the second floor,
        horizontal wood siding over wood frame on the second floor, and a plank-truss
        roof system with original wood shingles. Originally used as a livestock barn,
        it was modified in 1934 to serve as a small grain elevator as well. Grain
        was dumped into the ground chute outside the east end of the barn and moved
        by auger to pit in the barn floor. From there, a lifting mechanism (no longer
        in place) raised the grain to the top of the elevator, at which point it was
        directed into various plywood and metal chutes leading to different grain
        bins. This allowed the creation of feed mixes tailored to specific livestock
        needs. Feed from a given bin could be loaded into trucks through a metal chute
        penetrating the exterior wall of the bin and barn.","photo_url":"https://stage.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=Photograph:
